        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p>Kimchi is a naturally fermented product. So like a fine wine or cheese, it takes time for its full flavor to blossom. During the natural fermentation process, pressure builds up inside the jar. This natural pressure adds to the unique flavor of King's Kimchi and gives it a longer shelf life.</p>
        <p>A few suggestions to enjoy King's Kimchi at its absolute best...</p>

            <h2>Storage tips</h2>
            <p>Store King's Kimchi in the refrigerator after opening (30-40F for best results). </p>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>Not quite ready?  </h2>
            <p>A: Each person likes kimchi a bit differently. So, if you open a jar of King's Kimchi and it seems too fresh or the flavor isn't full enough, that means the fermentation process hasn't run its full course. Twist the cap back on and leave it in your sink overnight. The next morning, put it back in the refrigerator for a few hours. Then uncap and enjoy the full-flavor of the kimchi.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>How do I open a jar of King's Kimchi? </h2>
            <p>A: Like champagne, kimchi naturally builds pressure inside the jar. Sometimes the pressure is mild and sometimes it's a bit extreme, causing the cap to bulge. In either case, it's safe to eat... it just takes a little finesse to keep your kitchen clean. </p>

            <h2>To open a jar of kimchi:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Hold the jar over the sink.</li>
                <li>Cover the cap with a paper towel.</li>
                <li>Slowly twist the lid off to let the pressure release.</li>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>Stuck cap?</h2>
            <p>A: If the jar won't open, tap around the edge of the cap with something hard (like the back of a butter knife.) If the cap still won't budge, try turning the jar upside down for 10 seconds under a warm running faucet. Then turn the jar back over to try again – just be sure to hold it over the sink and cover the cap with a paper towel.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h2>The cap is stuck or bulging. Is it okay to eat? What can I do?</h2>
            <p>A: Fermentation creates natural pressure inside the jar. This sometimes makes the caps bulge or stick a bit. The bulging cap is completely normal, and the kimchi is perfectly safe to eat. Click here for ways to open a stuck cap.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>The Kimchi "bubbles" or sprays out when the jar is opened. Is it safe to eat?</h2>
            <p>A: Yes. Kimchi is a naturally fermenting product that builds pressure inside the jar. When the jar is opened, the pressure releases and bubbles to the surface.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>Is King's Kimchi vegetarian/vegan? Is it a raw food?</h2>

            <h2>The Kimchi tastes a little funny. What should I do?</h2>
            <p>A: First, check the "Enjoy By" date. It the date has passed, please discard the product. If the "Enjoy By" date is still more than 5 months ahead, then the Kimchi may not have fermented sufficiently. You can leave the Kimchi out overnight (in the sink) and replace it in the refrigerator the next day. You should then be able to enjoy the full-flavor of the Kimchi.

        <div class="question">
            <h2>What can I do after the cabbage becomes soft?</h2>
            <p>A: Kings Kimchi has a shelf life of six months. In the last stages of fermentation, the cabbage may lose it firmness and become soft or wilted. Koreans typically don't discard this Kimchi. Instead, it's usually used for soups to add flavor or spiciness. Try our simple and delicious kimchi soup recipe.</p>
